										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thinking of getting a credit card? Let me give you some pros and cons of getting a credit card. I am not associated with any credit card agency nor a financial advisor. I am just putting out this article as I get a lot of queries from my friends on whether credit cards are worth it or not. My usual answer is:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>YES, it has a lot to offer if you are good with your financial budgeting and NO if you are not.</p></blockquote>



<p>Yes, that&#8217;s all. That is the answer to the question. But if you like to hear more about the perks of having a credit card over a debit card, do keep reading.</p>



<p>A credit card is technically very similar to debit card and the main difference being you are not paying upfront the amount you shopped for, its more like a &#8220;Buy Now Pay Later&#8221; policy.</p>



<h4><strong>Why should I use Credit Card?</strong></h4>



<p>Everyone who has opened a bank account will mostly be having their own debit card. Then why would one manage one more card? Here are some benefits of credit card over debit card.</p>



<ol><li><strong>Credit History? CIBIL Score</strong>: In India or around the world, credit card is one of the best ways to create a good Credit History(or a CIBIL score), which helps in quick approval of loans such as personal loans or home loans and even to get a better interest rate deal. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, just getting a credit card won&#8217;t get you a good credit score, there are different parameters like how timely you pay your bills, etc.</li><li><strong>Fraud Protection:</strong> If any fraud/unauthorized transactions occur on your credit card it&#8217;s not your liability (subject to TnC of course). As soon as you encounter one, you should alert your card company to block your card. Rest all the card company takes care of, as the money from your end is safe and not lost, what is lost is the credit(basically, money from the card issuer). Thus these companies usually provide higher grade of security offerings to these credit accounts. Thus it is always better to use credit cards, especially for online transactions.</li><li><strong>Interest-Free Period</strong>. Most credit cards provide you interest-free period of 45-50 days. Your bills are generated monthly only. Thus even if you buy something now u will mostly have to pay within 20-50 days depending on your date of purchase and billing cycle. If you are using other forms of payment you are losing this amount upfront. In credit cards case, the money is still in your account, which can earn you interest based on your saving account scheme.</li><li><strong>Short Term Loan / No cost EMIs</strong>: If you plan your billing cycles properly, Credit Cards can also help when you are in a Cash Crunch situation, especially during month-ends when you are eagerly waiting for the salary credited SMS and don&#8217;t really want to bother your friends for a loan. Such short term loans can be taken care by credit cards. In situations when you want to buy your dream gadgets or your dream phone, you could use EMI options available, and in some cards, No Cost EMIs are also available, thus reducing the burden on your monthly budget.</li><li><strong>Tracking your monthly expenses</strong>: Credit cards are billed monthly. Thus you receive monthly expense statements which usually equates to your monthly expense if all your expenses were through your credit card.</li><li><strong>Offers/ reward points and more</strong>: Fuel Surcharge waivers, free Airport Lounge access, extra discounts or offers on ecommerce sites, etc are the cherry on top. Also, there are rewards even for paying your credit card bill through apps like Cred. You can use <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://app.cred.club/spQx/d18ba9c2" target="_blank">my referral link</a> to join Cred.</li></ol>



<h4>Is it all sunshine and rainbows?</h4>



<p>Every coin has two sides, credit cards have got their disadvantages too.</p>



<ol><li><strong>Chances of overspending</strong>: As money doesn&#8217;t easily get debited from your bank account it gives a false sense that you are not overspending. It is very important that always consider credit card as another debit card and spend only that much you have kept in your monthly budget for expenses.</li><li><strong>Higher Interest Rate and Late Payment fee</strong>: Be cautious that after the interest-free period the interest rate charged is usually very high. So it&#8217;s very important to pay your credit card bills before the due date in full otherwise, you will end up in a big debt trap and that&#8217;s what Credit card companies want. Turning ON auto pay for credit cards helps a lot for these situations. There are also annual card fees depending on your card, which mostly get waived off after a particular amount thus urging people to spend more.</li><li><strong>Financial Privacy</strong>: These cards come with an undisclosed clause of foregoing your financial privacy, as all your expense history is recorded through your card usage by these companies. Which is analyzed and used to learn your financial patterns, spending cycle, interests etc. But this is the case with any form of cashless medium. This is one of the main reasons why big conglomerates such as Facebook, Google are after India&#8217;s UPI system and its 1.4 billion market.</li></ol>

<h4><strong>Rules to abide by</strong></h4>



<p>If you do decide to use credit cards, remember these simple rules:</p>



<ul><li>Keep track of all your purchases.</li><li>Don&#8217;t spend outside your budget.</li><li>Pay off your balance in full, on all of your credit cards at the end of each month.</li><li>Don&#8217;t loan your credit or give out your credit card information to anyone.</li></ul>
